                            of the series<br> that i was introduced to. Receiving this as a gift along with the OG Playstation,
                            I've spent countless hours<br> upon hours grinding through this games a multitude of times just trying
                            out different<br> combinations of teams and leveling materia. (Materia = orbs that give you magical powers

                        <p id="Room">"The game that has won over Disney and Final Fantasy fans since its release. This game is a definite<br>
                            favorite if mine becuase this amazing piece of artwork brings in all the Disney worlds into one place.<br>
                            What i mean by this is that in the game as the main character Sora, you travel with Donald and Goofy<br> to
                            go defeat the "Darkness" that has befallen all the worlds of Disney. So its your job to go to places<br> like
                            Neverland, Visit Alice in her Wonderland, Take on a giant Chameleon with Tarzan in the Jungles,<br> and a
                            wide variety of other tasks that take you through the beautifly designed worlds. <br>The third installment
                            of the series is set to release either late 2018 or sometime in 2019."

                        <p id="Room">"Battlefield is the shoot-em up title that i love to get behind my computer and start 
                            rampaging through<br> hours of capturing flags, team deathmatch, and just going around 
                            taking other players out of<br> the game with my friends. A few of the things that i feel
                            this game excels at are the graphics,<br> which are always extremely beautiful, the realism 
                            of shooting a bullet and it having drop or wind to deal with,<br> and the overall fun you can
                            have running around playing the game."
