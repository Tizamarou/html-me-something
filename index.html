                    <h2>Super Smash Bros!</h2>
                    <p>"This Game is the epidomy of fighting titles. Dating all the way back
                        to when i was just 7 years old, this game has been ever evolving.
                        Bringing in 3 completely new titles over the years and about to release
                        a new game on the Nintendo Switch. This game has inspired me to want to play
                        fighting games, competeing always against my friends and other players
                        it brings an enjoyment that can be lived out an unlimited amount of times"

                        <h3>Final Fantasy 7</h3>
                        <p>"There are countless titles in the library of Final Fantasy. Final fantasy 7 is the first title
                            of the series that i was introduced to. Receiving this as a gift along with the OG Playstation,
                            I've spent countless hours upon hours grinding through this games a multitude of times just trying
                            out different combinations of teams and leveling materia. (Materia = orbs that give you magical powers
                            to use in game) There is currently a remake in progress with no release date."

                        <h4>Kingdom Hearts</h4>
                        <p>"The game that has won over Disney and Final Fantasy fans since its release. This game is a definite
                            favorite if mine becuase this amazing piece of artwork brings in all the Disney worlds into one place.
                            What i mean by this is that in the game as the main character Sora, you travel with Donald and Goofy to
                            go defeat the "Darkness" that has befallen all the worlds of Disney. So its your job to go to places like
                            Neverland, Visit Alice in her Wonderland, Take on a giant Chameleon with Tarzan in the Jungles, and a
                            wide variety of other tasks that take you through the beautifly designed worlds. The third installment
                            of the series is set to release either late 2018 or sometime in 2019."

                        <a name="Battlefield"></a>
                        <h6>Battlefield</h6>
                        <p>"Battlefield is the shoot-em up title that i love to get behind my computer and start 
                            rampaging through hours of capturing flags, team deathmatch, and just going around 
                            taking other players out of the game with my friends. A few of the things that i feel
                            this game excels at are the graphics, which are always extremely beautiful, the realism 
                            of shooting a bullet and it having drop or wind to deal with, and the overall fun you can
                            have running around playing the game."
